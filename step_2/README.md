**Tips:**
- Compiling and building your application using:
``` sh
    go run person.go     # no intermediate binary created
    go build             # binary 'step_2' ends up in current directory
    go install           # binary 'step_2' ends up in '${GOPATH}/bin'-directory
    ${GOPATH}/bin/step_2 # to start your application
```
