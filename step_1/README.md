**Prepare your environment:**
```
    mkdir ~/go
    export GOPATH=~/go                                # define GOPATH
    go get github.com/MarcGrol/go-training            # to fetch and install
    cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/MarcGrol/go-training  # start editing
    ${GOPATH}/bin/go-training                         # to run program
